    <title>Shaun Munshi: Assignment 5a</title>
    <!-- Grader Notes: This is my Assignment 5a. I have rendered a sphere, a cylinder, and a cube that has the minecraft
    diamond texture block on it. I also rendered a Katana from PolyPiza. I took code from the provided tutorials, Rohan 
    and Wendy's sections, as well as stack overflow to render the background and orbital controls properly. I know orbital controls is not neccesary,
    but I accidentaly thought it was part of 5a-->
